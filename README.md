# Disease Prediction Using BERT

Welcome to the Disease Prediction project! This initiative focuses on utilizing BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a powerful model developed by Google, to predict diseases based on clinical notes. By fine-tuning BERT, this project aims to harness the potential of natural language processing (NLP) to classify and understand complex medical text data.

## Introduction

Disease prediction is a critical task in the medical field, enabling early diagnosis and treatment planning. This project leverages the BERT model to analyze clinical notes and accurately predict various diseases. The goal is to provide a robust, efficient, and scalable solution for medical professionals to aid in their decision-making processes.

## Features

The project boasts several key features:
1. **Fine-tuned BERT Model**: The BERT model is fine-tuned specifically for medical text classification, enhancing its ability to understand and process clinical notes.
2. **User-Friendly Interface**: An interactive web interface allows users to easily upload clinical notes and receive predictions.
3. **Comprehensive Results**: Detailed predictions, including the predicted disease, descriptions, recommended medicines, and specialists, are provided for each clinical note.
4. **Extensive Evaluation Metrics**: The project includes scripts to evaluate the model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Setup

To get started with the project, you need to ensure that your environment is correctly set up. This includes cloning the repository, setting up a virtual environment, and installing the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. The project is built with Python 3.6 or higher, and you'll need the `pip` package manager to install dependencies.

## Usage

### Training the Model

Before making predictions, the BERT model needs to be fine-tuned with your dataset of clinical notes. The training process involves preparing your dataset, ensuring it is in the correct format (e.g., CSV, JSON), and running the training script. The script allows you to configure various parameters, such as the number of epochs and batch size, to optimize the training process. 

### Making Predictions

Once the model is trained, you can use the provided prediction script to make predictions on new clinical notes. The script processes the input file, makes predictions using the trained model, and outputs the results in a specified format. Additionally, an interactive web interface is provided, allowing users to upload files and receive instant predictions directly through a web browser.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of clinical notes labeled with corresponding diseases. It is crucial to preprocess and clean the data to ensure the model can effectively learn from it. This involves tasks such as removing irrelevant information, normalizing text, and handling missing values.

## Model

The core of this project is the BERT model, known for its state-of-the-art performance in various NLP tasks. BERT is pre-trained on a vast corpus of text and then fine-tuned on the specific task of disease prediction. The model is implemented using the `transformers` library by Hugging Face, which provides tools and utilities for working with BERT and other transformer models.

## Training

The training process involves fine-tuning the BERT model on your dataset of clinical notes. The training script handles loading the data, configuring the model, and running the training loop. Key hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs can be adjusted to optimize the training process. The results, including model checkpoints and performance metrics, are saved for further evaluation and use.

## Evaluation

After training, the model's performance is evaluated using a dedicated evaluation script. This script computes various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, providing insights into how well the model performs on the test dataset. Detailed evaluation reports, including confusion matrices and classification reports, are generated to help understand the model's strengths and weaknesses.

## Results

The results of the training and evaluation processes are stored in the `results/` directory. These results include model checkpoints, evaluation reports, and visualizations such as loss and accuracy plots. These resources provide a comprehensive view of the model's performance and can be used for further analysis and improvement.
